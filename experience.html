											I have been actively supporting the Project Controls & Fuel Handling department, earning three Values in Action employee recognition awards with plans to receive more. In addition, I automated the forecasting tool to project finances across all departments, resulting in monthly time savings of over 89 hours. I also developed an automated report generating tool using Power Automate, which not only saves 2 hours every time the report is run but also significantly reduces reporting errors. Furthermore, I took the lead in field operations for relay replacements, collaborating closely with maintenance and operations teams, while successfully troubleshooting electrical schematic diagrams and completing the project four days ahead of schedule. On the engineering front, I created an FH085 document from scratch to support the OM&A project for the Fuel Handling department and devised a PowerBI tool to effectively track work orders, deadlines, and associated costs. Additionally, through thorough analysis of project finances, I managed to save the Project Controls department over 3 million dollars' worth of unallocated costs.

										<h3 class="major">Technical Management Group</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tmg.gif" alt="" /></span>
											I conducted comprehensive risk assessments across various domains, including Site Investigation Core Logging (Vent Raises), Hydraulic Pre-Conditions, Well Drilling, and Ventilation Ducting for Newcrest Mining. My expertise extends to applying Pincock perspectives to assess contingency, accuracy, likelihood, and consequence of projects. Additionally, I undertook a substantial analysis of over 1,000 mining companies listed on the TSX and TSX: V by utilizing NI 43-101 reports, enabling me to identify the top 10 clients and projects to pursue, employing a detailed criteria, multi-level filter, and weighting ranking system. This strategic approach resulted in the acquisition of three new clients and informed the pursuit of the remaining seven, potentially generating millions in revenue. Moreover, I authored a white paper delving into the intersection of Risk Management and Renewable Energy on Mine Sites, outlining practical applications within the industry and emphasizing the value of an owner's team and technical modeling. Furthermore, I conducted financial modeling to evaluate the feasibility of mining projects, specifically in terms of CAPEX and OPEX. In an effort to enhance efficiency, I designed an auto-populated document system using Python and Excel, streamlining the process of filling out vendor contracts, NDA agreements, and various forms, resulting in a remarkable time-saving of over 15 minutes per document.
