										<h3 class="major">Ontario Power Generation</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/OPG1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
											During my internship at Ontario Power Generation, I played a crucial role in enhancing efficiency and streamlining processes across multiple departments. By simultaneously supporting both Project Controls and Fuel Handling, I contributed to significant operational improvements and was honored with three ViA employee recognition awards for my efforts.
											<br><br>
											One of my key achievements was automating monthly forecasting reports for all Darlington Nuclear Projects, resulting in a remarkable time savings of 89 hours per month. This automation not only boosted productivity but also allowed the team to focus on higher-value tasks.
											</p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/OPG3.png" alt="" /></span>
											In addition, I led the relay replacement field operation, where I collaborated closely with project stakeholders to troubleshoot and resolve issues within the electrical schematic. Our teamwork and proactive problem-solving enabled us to complete the project four days ahead of schedule, showcasing our commitment to excellence and timely project delivery.

										<h3 class="major">Technical Management Group</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/tmg.gif" alt="" /></span>
											In my role, I delivered impactful results through strategic risk management and operational improvements. One of my key accomplishments was conducting a Monte Carlo risk assessment on a client's brine management system, achieving an 85% confidence level. This assessment led to a comprehensive risk mitigation plan that saved the client $4.41 millionâ€”a 72% cost reduction from the original strategy.
										</p>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/tmg1.png" alt="" /></span>
											I also developed critical standard operating procedures, scopes of work, and requests for proposals tailored for client mine sites, ensuring efficiency and compliance across operations.
											<br><br>
											Additionally, I created a sophisticated multi-level filter and ranking process to analyze all mining companies listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. This analysis was presented to the leadership team, resulting in the acquisition of 3 new clients and the strategic pursuit of 7 additional companies, significantly expanding our client base.

I facilitated client meetings and team discussions to maximize workflow and team dynamics.
