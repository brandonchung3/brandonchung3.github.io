                                            During the 2024 QICSI summer incubator, I co-founded Sequin Health, a healthcare SaaS startup designed to improve patient-therapist matching through a cutting-edge algorithm. This 16-week intensive program by Queen’s University provided a platform to develop and refine our vision. I led strategic operations and external stakeholder communications, playing a key role in building relationships with registered psychotherapists and venture capital investors. Our efforts led to successfully securing $4,000 in seed funding, driving the startup’s growth. Sequin Health is committed to making mental health care more accessible and personalized, leveraging technology to ensure patients find the right therapist fit.

											During the 2024 QICSI incubator, one of the toughest challenges I faced was navigating cofounder dynamics and aligning on the vision for Sequin Health. Balancing differing perspectives required strong communication, compromise, and a shared commitment to the company’s mission. Additionally, gaining traction in a competitive healthcare market was no small feat. We had to work tirelessly to refine our value proposition, build credibility with psychotherapists, and secure investor interest. Although we ultimately decided not to pursue the business further, the journey taught me valuable lessons about resilience, strategic planning, and adapting to real-world market demands. The insights I gained continue to shape my approach to future ventures and professional growth.

                                            In a high-pressure environment with less than 20 hours to prepare, our team rose to the challenge, navigating numerous obstacles to deliver a compelling pitch. The experience was intense yet rewarding, requiring us to think on our feet, collaborate effectively, and present our ideas to a panel of esteemed judges.

											We pitched Mirvie, a groundbreaking biotechnology company focused on predicting pregnancy complications before they occur through noninvasive testing. Our dedication and teamwork, alongside the invaluable mentorship led us to secure second place and a $1000 prize.

                                            Growing up in a DIY-focused family, I quickly became known as a hands-on troubleshooter, which led to my contracting journey in 2020. After building our first deck, demand for my services surged, and I seized the opportunity to scale my business by leveraging my engineering background to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. I built a trusted team, marketed through a website and social media, and secured over 15 major projects worth more than $10,000. My work stands out by combining technical expertise with creative design, using SolidWorks to model and refine interlock patterns.
											<br><br>
											Additionally, my experience as a property manager during my time at Queen’s University in Kingston honed my organizational and project management skills. Overseeing multiple properties, I applied my hands-on renovation experience and coordinated with various stakeholders to ensure every project met the highest standards. Whether managing routine maintenance or leading large-scale renovations, I consistently delivered results with professionalism and attention to detail.
