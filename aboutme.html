                                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                                    <p style="font-size: 14px; text-transform: none;">I am a highly motivated engineering student with a childlike passion for learning. I am looking to expand my experience in engineering design, finance, and entrepreneurship. My recent experiences in various institutions such as Queen's University and my community have fueled my desire to become a leader no matter where I find myself.
										<br><br>
										A time that stands out at Queen's was in my fall semester in my third year when I was faced with one of my greatest hurdles. I was managing a full engineering course load while training and competing to win gold at the OUA rowing championship.  I dedicated upwards of 20 hours of high-performance training with 5:20 a.m. practices and secondary weight training while working as a teaching assistant. In the midst of this, I was trying to juggle my health, social life, and club extracurriculars which was extremely difficult if I was away on the weekend during a completion. 
										<br><br>								
										People always asked me how did you do this all? Did you get burnt out? Why are you killing yourself? 
										<br><br>
										In short, I love it all! I love the fast-paced environment and pushing my human capabilities of what I can achieve. 
										<br><br>
										I learned to prioritize and time manage effectively, truly embracing the chaos. I don't claim to have any special abilities besides my resilience and work ethic. I strongly believe that presentence, grit and hard work can overcome any obstacle as long as you're truly willing to sacrifice for it. </a></p>

										<h2 class="major">Rowing</h2>
										<p>My story as a varsity rower at Queen's was unique in the sense that I had no prior rowing experience before joining the team. This all started during the height of COVID-19 when all sports and extracurriculars got shut down, which was a big part of my life. Growing up I fell in love with the comradery and fierce competition in sports and going into University I missed this feeling. 
											<br><br>
											I took the leap to try out for the Novice Rowing team where Queen's recruited new rowers with strong athletic backgrounds. Out of over 300 candidates, 30 were selected. This new sport shook up my routine with 5:20 AM practices, afternoon weight sessions, cross-trains, film work, physiotherapy sessions, and proper dieting while managing a full engineering course load. 
											<br><br>									
											Initially, I had a steep learning curve but this period in my life truly tested my grit, resiliency, and ability to time manage. I devoted every moment of my free time to improving as a rower, which allowed me to make the Varsity Rowing team. I was the only novice to make it through the Rowing team and eventually won gold at the Ontario University Rowing Championships in the lightweight men's double.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Cheerleading</h2>
										<p>Similar to rowing, I also joined the summer varsity cheerleading club at Queen's. I am all for trying new things and I wanted to continue my involvement at Queen's even through my internship. What better way than trying out a new sport? During this time, I made many great friends and learned to stunt in teams and pairs. Fun fact I learned how to do a back tuck in the summer of 2023!

										<p>A time I will always look back on my community, lifetime friends, and experiences at Queen's. The honorary jacket slams are done as a Queen's tradition after engineering students finish their last exam. This was done with my cohort of mechanical engineers after completing my last 3rd-year exam.

									<p>My interest in sports and athletics carries over to all aspects of my life. The collaboration from sports has been proven to carry over when working with multidisciplinary engineering teams. The grit and determination to achieve my goals is a fortified mentality that I hold in all aspects of my life.</p>
