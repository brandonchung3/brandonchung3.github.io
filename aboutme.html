                                    <p style="font-size: 14px; text-transform: none;">
										I’m a driven engineering student with a passion for learning and expanding my skills in design, finance, and entrepreneurship. My experiences at Queen’s University and beyond have shaped me into a leader, both academically and athletically. I thrive in fast-paced environments, balancing a full engineering course load with high-performance athletics, teaching assistant roles, and extracurriculars. I approach challenges with resilience, prioritization, and hard work, believing that perseverance and grit can overcome any obstacle.

										<h2 class="major">Rowing</h2>
										<p>
											My journey as a varsity rower at Queen’s was one of resilience and discovery. With no prior rowing experience, I tried out for the Novice Rowing team during COVID-19 and was one of 30 selected out of over 300 candidates. The demanding schedule of early morning practices, weight training, and physiotherapy, combined with my engineering studies, tested my grit. My hard work paid off when I became the only novice to make the Varsity team, winning gold at the Ontario University Rowing Championships in the lightweight men’s double.

										<h2 class="major">Cheerleading</h2>
										<p>
											I love trying new things, and in the summer of 2023, I joined Queen's summer varsity cheerleading club. It was a fantastic experience that helped me stay active while continuing my involvement at Queen’s during my internship. I learned stunting in teams and pairs and even mastered a backflip — a personal highlight!

										<p>
											One of the most cherished memories of my time at Queen’s is the jacket slam tradition, where our engineering cohort came together to celebrate completing our final exams. It was a moment of shared achievement with lifelong friends, embodying the strong sense of community that defines Queen's.

									<p>My love for sports and athletics influences every part of my life. The collaboration and teamwork I’ve experienced in sports have translated seamlessly into working with multidisciplinary engineering teams. The grit and determination to achieve my goals, both academically and athletically, are traits I apply to all areas of my life, from tackling engineering challenges to pushing my physical limits.</p>
