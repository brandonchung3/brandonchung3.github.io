								<h2>Founder Experience</h2>
								<p>
									In the summer of 2023, I started my first business BC Enterprise, a landscaping company that transforms concepts into reality by seamlessly blending property aesthetics with functional design.

                                            During the 2024 QICSI summer incubator, I co-founded Sequin Health, a healthcare SaaS startup designed to improve patient-therapist matching through a cutting-edge algorithm. This 16-week intensive program by Queen’s University provided a platform to develop and refine our vision. I led strategic operations and external stakeholder communications, playing a key role in building relationships with registered psychotherapists and venture capital investors. Our efforts led to successfully securing $4,000 in seed funding, driving the startup’s growth. Sequin Health is committed to making mental health care more accessible and personalized, leveraging technology to ensure patients find the right therapist fit.
											<br><br>
											During the 2024 QICSI incubator, one of the toughest challenges I faced was navigating cofounder dynamics and aligning on the vision for Sequin Health. Balancing differing perspectives required strong communication, compromise, and a shared commitment to the company’s mission. Additionally, gaining traction in a competitive healthcare market was no small feat. We had to work tirelessly to refine our value proposition, build credibility with psychotherapists, and secure investor interest. Although we ultimately decided not to pursue the business further, the journey taught me valuable lessons about resilience, strategic planning, and adapting to real-world market demands. The insights I gained continue to shape my approach to future ventures and professional growth.

                                            In a high-pressure environment with less than 20 hours to prepare, our team rose to the challenge, navigating numerous obstacles to deliver a compelling pitch. The experience was intense yet rewarding, requiring us to think on our feet, collaborate effectively, and present our ideas to a panel of esteemed judges.
											<br><br>
											We pitched Mirvie, a groundbreaking biotechnology company focused on predicting pregnancy complications before they occur through noninvasive testing. Our dedication and teamwork, alongside the invaluable mentorship led us to secure second place and a $1000 prize.

                                            Growing up in a DIY family, I quickly developed a reputation as a hands-on troubleshooter. 
											<br><br>
											In 2020, my brother and I built our first deck. I gained an immense amount of experience while building the deck, and this led to helping neighbors with home projects like staining fences and building bookshelves. 
											<br><br>
											As demand grew, I recognized the potential in home renovation and real estate design, prompting me to take the business more seriously.
                                            <br><br>
											During my time at Queen’s University, I also gained valuable experience as a property manager, further sharpening my organizational and project management skills. 
											<br><br>
											To scale my renovation business, I built a trusted team and used my engineering background to streamline processes. 
											<br><br>
											By designing interlock patterns in SolidWorks, I combined efficiency with creativity. 
											Through marketing efforts, I secured over 15 major projects worth $10,000, setting the stage for future growth.
