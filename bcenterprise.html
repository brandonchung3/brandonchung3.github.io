								<h2>BC Enterprise</h2>
								<p>In the summer of 2023, I started my first business BC Enterprise, a landscaping company that transforms concepts into reality by seamlessly blending property aesthetics with functional design.

                                            Growing up, my family was keen on do-it-yourself renovations, where I earned the reputation of being an excellent hands-on troubleshooter. My brother and I built our first deck in the summer of 2020 when our neighbor took notice and asked if we could help with his home projects. This included straining his fence, sealing his driveway, building bookshelves, and much more! 
                                            <br><br>
                                            Word of mouth spread, and I simply didn't have enough people to help with the surplus of work. This is when I realized there was a high demand for home renovation and real estate design which is when I made the decision to take this opportunity more seriously. 
                                            </p>

                                            With plans to scale bigger for the next season, I plan to utilize my engineering background to make the process more efficient. I have also started creating a website and promoting my business using social media. 
                                            <br><br>
                                            I started to build a trusted team around me to help with the labor while I pushed the marketing side printing business cards and doing door-to-door sales. I was able to get over 15 major projects worth over $10, 000.
                                            <br><br>
                                            What made me stand out as a contractor was my ability to leverage my intrinsic engineering background with my love for creative expression. I would model the interlock patterns on SolidWorks which allowed me to trial with different dimensions and designs more efficiently.
